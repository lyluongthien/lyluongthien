### 👋 Wellcome to my GitHub

#### Hi there, I’m Kai 
 
 
 _(If you want a more complicated pronunciation, I’m Lý Lưỡng Thiên ;) )_

#### and there are some facts about me:
- 🧑🏻‍💻 As an engineer, I started my career at my 20 - 2019. Digging in T shape with 
  - Horizontal line: frontend & μFE, mobile, desktop, ide, compiler,...
  - Vertical line: Backend, μservices, and scaling systems
- 📝 As a writer, I’ve written a lot (of course 😆) on the engineering side: [thediligentengineer.com](https://thediligentengineer.com)
- 👨🏻‍🍼 As a dad, I’m taking an “internship” at my home to raise my first kid - Gấu, her IG is <a align="right" href="https://instagram.com/gauxinhtuoicuaba">

- 🥋 As a Karate-Ka, I’m striving to achieve my black belt next year after 10 years of practising Nghiadung Karate-Do (義勇空手道) (since 2014).
- 👨🏼‍🍳 As a cook 😉, I’m cooking at Momos and my apartment. My best dish is _Thịt bằm xào anh - “Minced meat stir-fried with me”_ (Tonkin jasmine flowers - a homophone of Thiên Lý (me)  in Vietnamese 😉)
